    title: Clean Layered Architecture Enforces Separation of Concerns
    left:
      - API Layer handles HTTP and validation
      - Service Layer contains all business logic
      - Repository Layer abstracts database access
      - Unidirectional dependency flow prevents coupling
    right:
      - Frontend React + TypeScript + Vite
      - Backend Rust + Actix-web + SQLx
      - Database PostgreSQL with partitioning
      - Caching Redis for real-time status
